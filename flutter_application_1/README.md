# Hack Technology / Project Attempted

## What you built? 

I have had some experience with React Native, and with inspiration from one of the shared papers in class, I wanted to learn how Google Flutter differs. 

I first built an empty and simplistic Flutter project.
After building this with a tutorial, I attempted to clone a already existing mobile application to see if I could do try the same.

## Who Did What?

This was an inidividual project and attempt.

For the first part of this hack-a-thing, I followed a tutorial provided by Flutter documentation.
For the second part of this hack-a-thing, I found a shopping UI application for my attempt to clone. To start, I took the structure of how they organized the project. Then, I attempted to write the models, pages, and configuration. I tried to do write some styling, but instead adopted the styling from the developer who owns the application. When I was stumped or ran into errors I couldn't figure out, I consulted stack overflow and the open source code for this application.

## What you learned

What Worked: In general, I learned that I was able to develop a basic Flutter project. I was able to see how there are a few flexible components about Flutter, but personally, I am able to make the conclusion that Dart is a little uncomfortable for me. I prefer React Native because of how Javascript seems a little more easy and more elegant to implement.

What didn't Work: The Flutter project that I attempted to clone did not succeed. I think this was because I did not have enough time to familiarize myself with the hierarchy and widget implementation that comes with the Dart language. It was truly a rough start to clone this, but I did learn a lot from experimenting. It was cool to see a few of the components seen in the application to come together, but for sure, I think I would need a lot more time to implement all its features.

Outcome: I was able to succeed in two working pages, but testing output with a android emulator took much time for output testing and debugging. I have had difficulty and faced error in extensions for widgets.
